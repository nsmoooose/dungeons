Some things to get done

* TODO Embed help as files in the binary?
  Here is a good link on how to do this:
  http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/embedding-file-executable-aka-hello-world-version-5967
* TODO Stack of callback handlers for the terminal gui.
  Basically I want to push, pop the callback handlers. This way
  you can end one part of the game by pop:ing to get back to the
  main menu.

  Build a d_stack struct and functions.
  - d_stack_create
  - d_stack_destroy
  - d_stack_push
  - d_stack_pop
  - d_stack_at

* TODO Message box widget.
  - Push callback handlers.
  - Draw handler uses previous draw handler and after that it will
	draw with its own.
  - When keyboard is pressed we pop the callback handlers.
